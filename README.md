This project is a starting point for refactoring the `statement` function from the 1st chapter of Martin Fowler's book `Refactoring: Second Edition`

A test file named `statement.test.js` is already written to check the validity of the output. Run the command below to execute the tests and continuously re-test when files are changes. This is very useful during refactoring.
`npm test -- --watch`
